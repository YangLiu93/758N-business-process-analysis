# Web Development
This directory consists homework and project we have done in Web Development course. It makes use of Django framework in Python.

In the project folder, we designed website for an eCommerce company (like Amazon). We managed to offer the login, product purchase, order summary and product returns functions for the company. Customers can log into their own account, view their past purchases,  buy products and return the products which have defects.

The project is done using Django framework. Databases are manipulated in Models part, HTML templates are designed within Template part, and user requests are dealt in Views part.
